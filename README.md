## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced use of the Solana blockchain for financial and system-level programming. Each program in this repository serves a distinct purpose:
- **Escrow**: Handles secure transactions between two parties.
- **Fundraiser**: Enables crowdfunding with token contributions.
- **Vault**: Implements optimized storage for tokens, including native Solana assembly.
- **SBPF-Close**: An example of Solana BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programming with low-level operations.

## Programs

### Escrow

- **Location**: `escrow/`
- **Description**: A program to handle secure transactions between two parties. It includes instructions for creating, funding, and executing escrow agreements.
- **Entrypoint**: [`process_instruction`](./escrow/src/lib.rs)

#### Instructions
- `make.rs`: Initiates an escrow.
- `take.rs`: Completes an escrow transaction.
- `refund.rs`: Handles refunds in case of disputes.

---

### Fundraiser

- **Location**: `fundraiser/`
- **Description**: A crowdfunding platform where contributors can support fundraisers using SPL tokens. It includes checks for fundraising goals and refund mechanisms.
- **Entrypoint**: [`process_instruction`](./fundraiser/src/lib.rs)

#### Instructions
- `initialize.rs`: Sets up a new fundraiser.
- `contribute.rs`: Accepts contributions to the fundraiser.
- `check.rs`: Verifies contributions against goals.
- `refund.rs`: Processes refunds for incomplete fundraisers.

#### Tests
Unit tests for the fundraiser are located in the `tests` module. Example tests include:
- `contribute_test.rs`
- `refund_test.rs`

---

### Vault

- **Location**: `vault/`
- **Description**: Implements token vault functionality with different levels of optimization:
  - **Based**: Standard implementation.
  - **Optimized**: Performance-tuned version.
  - **Native**: Low-level native Solana implementation.

#### Modules
- `based.rs`: Basic vault implementation.
- `optimized.rs`: Optimized storage and retrieval.
- `native.rs`: Native assembly-level implementation.

---

### SBPF-Close

- **Location**: `sbpf-close/`
- **Description**: A program written in SBPF (Solana BPF) for low-level account operations.
- **Entrypoint**: [`sbpf_close.s`](./sbpf-close/src/sbpf_close/sbpf_close.s)

This program demonstrates advanced techniques like closing accounts and transferring lamports in assembly.

---

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Rust and Cargo installed ([Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).
- Solana CLI tools installed ([Installation Guide](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)).

### Build
Run the following command in the root directory to build all programs:
```bash
cargo build-bpf
```

### Deploy
Use the Solana CLI to deploy a program:
```bash
solana program deploy ./path/to/program.so
```

### Run Tests
Run unit tests for a specific program:
```bash
cargo test --manifest-path ./program-name/Cargo.toml
```

---

## Building and Testing

### Testing Individual Programs
Each program includes its own unit tests. Navigate to the program directory and run:
```bash
cargo test
```

### Example
To test the fundraiser program:
```bash
cd fundraiser
cargo test-sbf
```
